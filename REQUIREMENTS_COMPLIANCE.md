# Flutter Task Requirements Compliance Check

## Original Task Requirements vs Implementation

### ✅ **Objective: Build a Flutter app screen for riders to:**
- [x] Display rider's current location on a map
- [x] Show markers for pickup locations and warehouse
- [x] Draw a full route from rider's current location through all pickups and ending at the warehouse
- [x] Enable a navigation experience using a 'Navigate' button to launch either in-app navigation or Google Maps

### ✅ **Requirements 1: Job Route Screen (Main Task)**
- [x] Show Google Map with:
  - [x] Rider's current location (via GPS)
  - [x] Markers for pickup locations
  - [x] Marker for the warehouse location
  - [x] A polyline route that:
    - [x] Starts from rider's current location
    - [x] Goes through each pickup (in the given order)
    - [x] Ends at the warehouse
- [x] Add a 'Navigate' button that:
  - [x] Either starts in-app navigation with live location updates and route following
  - [x] Or opens Google Maps with the full route using url_launcher
- [x] Optional: Show distance/time to warehouse (mocked or API-based)

### ✅ **Data Structure Compliance**
- [x] Uses exact data structure from requirements:
  ```dart
  {
    "id": 1,
    "location": LatLng(...),
    "time_slot": "9AM-10AM",
    "inventory": 5,
  }
  ```
- [x] Includes all 5 pickup locations with correct time slots and inventory
- [x] Includes warehouse location

### ✅ **Developer Note Compliance**
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Does NOT use exact coordinates from requirements
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Mocks 5 pickup locations within 5km radius of rider's current location
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Ensures realistic routing, marker clustering, and travel times
- [x] Pickup locations are dynamically generated based on rider's GPS position

### ✅ **Deliverables**
- [x] A single functional screen showing:
  - [x] Map with route from rider to pickups to warehouse
  - [x] All locations clearly marked
  - [x] Route drawn and displayed properly
  - [x] A 'Navigate' button with working navigation

## Implementation Details

### Map Features
- **Rider Location**: Blue marker showing current GPS position
- **Pickup Markers**: Green markers with info windows showing pickup ID, time slot, and inventory
- **Warehouse Marker**: Red marker with "Final destination" info
- **Route Polyline**: Blue line connecting rider → pickups → warehouse in order

### Navigation Options
- **In-App Navigation**: Opens dedicated navigation screen with turn-by-turn directions
- **Google Maps**: Launches external Google Maps with full route including waypoints

### Mock Data Strategy
- Pickup locations are generated within 5km of rider's current location
- Warehouse is placed ~2km from rider for realistic delivery scenarios
- All distances and times are calculated based on actual geographic coordinates

### UI Elements
- Clean, single-screen interface
- Route information overlay showing distance, time, and pickup count
- Prominent "Navigate" button at bottom
- Loading states and error handling

## Conclusion
✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT** - The app meets all original task requirements exactly as specified, including the critical developer note about mocking locations near the rider's current position rather than using the exact coordinates provided in the requirements.
